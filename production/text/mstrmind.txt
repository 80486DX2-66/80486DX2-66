Expected license : N/A (even an artifical, biorganism cannot be licensed)
General purpose  :
    A life form, to be accommodated and tested.
Description      :
    A  bio-mechanic machine with  artifical intellegence  that can dig through
    any loose (like fluids) and dense (like concrete buildings) substances.

>>> Technical description of body
    The  set  out  above biorganism represents a  1370mm*960mm*1370mm machine.
All   its  parts   are   para-mechanized  and  can   be  passed  on   to  next
generations without any corruptions.
    Pistons (legs, paws)  can  push  with up  to  8 megajoules  of force. Each
piston is a specific leg with a part that's on which it stands, and  a kind of
elbow between the larger part of the piston and the short part, connecting to
the main platform.  Each leg is fixed  on a rotary axis, and it's sticking out
at 45°.
    It  can  rest.  In  order  to  do  that,  it can fold its legs underneath.
It  weighs  12kg:  brain,  motherboard,  disks,  tentacles  (and  its  motor),
reproductive   organs  (including  620ml  tanks   with  reproductive  liquid),
electronic AC/DC converter, energy generator, voltage protector, biofuel tank,
additional microchips, autonomous sensors (triggers).
    If  you  will spell it a special key,  it will power off itself and unlock
hatches to  its  inner parts. When you are done with it, simply spell another.
Autonomous  sensors  will turn the  big  brain  back on,  unless  they are not
dismounted. It also features a tank with  self-regenerative chromosomes, which
can be refilled while the tank is on outside interference.
    The  tentacles  are  made  of a  synthesized substance: myosin + calcium +
+ silicon, wrapped in a black elastic skin-alike sheath.  The sheath have pink
pattern in style of  ancient greeks.  They can dig through substances of 1-950
g/cm^3 density,  including viscous ones.  The tentacles are wrapped around the
motor,  and  they come out under  the metallic plate through the special tube,
and further, tight lockable hatch. They have the mechanism of  semen speading,
a sense of temperature, echolocation of space. If the tentacles are  being cut
off by the creature itself, they will turn into a solution of water.
    The  core  of  the  brain,   central  nervous   system,  and  other  parts
are  para-mechanized  and  some  of them  are  built of synthesized biological
substances. The  brain  is located  on a mounting limb (45mm*280mm*45mm) which
is  connected  to the  primary 4 moving  pistons. The  computer  parts  run on
24 volts of DC voltage.
    It  has 2 eyes  that  are  blue  in  colour. Its eyes  can see, recognize,
differentiate, and  focus on  objects.  The  information  from  eyes is  being
transferred to brain and main computer.
    It have nasal receptors that can receive smells (analogue of a nose).  The
information  from  receptors is  being transferred  only to  brain.  It's  not
necessary  to   main  computer  because  the  artifical intellegence  does not
handles this kind of information. However, the brain itself can detect a smell
and will activate odour—action neuronal circuits automatically.
    The main platform  is equipped with  a laser.  The laser itself represents
a  metallic box  with  a round hole,  in which a special glass pane is tightly
inserted. This laser can be classified as a vital organ because it's connected
to power sockets. The creature usually uses the laser as one of its weapons.

>>> Behaviour patterns
    A W A K E. When it is awake, CNS can move into another state. Else it will
scan  environment to  prepare  before fighting  back against attackers or kill
hackers  that  are  trying  to  interrupt,  debug,   or  break  active machine
performance.
    E X P L O R A T I O N. When  it  is ready for adventures,  it  can explore
certain things, depending on its education and/or knowledge.
    W A L K. When it inspects area, breathing the  fresh air in morning, takes
shelter, or whenever it walks on its legs, it walks. It also can crawl, climb,
jump, swim. Always actively searchs for enemies and unstable substances. If it
finds, it takes measures to protect itself.
    T R A I N I N G. As  with  other  neural networks, it can train when it is
time to.  During an educational process, it can collect and save (write) data.
    S E A R C H. [Flawless creatures do not have this behaviour pattern] If it
is  manufactured  in  Japan,  the  following  bug can happen: the machine will
search for  a homo sapiens (human sentient)  of  opposite gender  to proceed a
reproduction act. Engineers speculate,  the defective component are tentacles.
A  wide  amount of Japanese literature  already has covered the same behaviour
of octopuses  that hunt down  for a victim  to  rape, although the act have no
reproductive sense.
    R E L A X. It   can  rest   like  humans   do,  like   computers  go  into
hibernation.  Usually,  it folds its legs underneath and  coil back or cut off
its tentacles (if they're stuck somewhere or too far away).
    S L E E P. When   the   creature  is  going  to  rest  for  a  long  time,
it  inspects area  for  enemies (hackers,  attackers)  and unstable substances
(explosives, acids, etc.)

>>> Artifical intellegence
    The  artifical  intellegence  have  knowledge  about  the  world,  humans,
materials, substances. The creature has  it as a essential part  of the brain:
It  recognizes  people,  speech,  actions, faces, objects with help of it. The
necessary  information to  move out and act is  located  there,  and this kind
of information  cannot be  deleted  due to certain  security measures. As with
other artificial intelligences, this one can learn from  the  world around it,
and people.

>>> CNS
    The central neural system plays an important role in order to be sentient.
It thinks  about emotional response  on  itself, without  a request. This part
controls the  sequence of actions,  appropriate  choice of  behaviour pattern.
Unlike a  human being,  the creature  doesn't  have moods and always in a cold
form of conscioussness.  It means that  thoughts are never subject to emotion,
but that does not invalidate humanity of the creature.
