Android devices with Google services
────────────────────────────────────
Scumbag apps (like Facebook) use Google Play Services to legally eavesdrop and
display  advertisements  using collected information  about you.  Surely, they
can't  directly  access microphones.  However,  Google works  with them.  When
you're   just   surfing  Internet   from   other   devices,  you   may  notice
personalized ads, if you're  connected to  Internet  with  same  IP address as
your Android device. Unfortunately, this unhealthy feature  cannot be disabled
anywhere. Many organisations are bribed, including but not limited to:
 - Google
 - Facebook
 - Twitter
 - Microsoft
 - Apple
 - Samsung
 - Yandex
Thus you can see personalised content  on Spotify, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter,
and other. This is how they make money.

The lack of digital freedom that spoils your peaceful life is a result of
 1) closed systems
 2) cohesive evil deeds of large corporations
 3) large corporations activities
 4) Supercookies and Third-Party cookies

In order to  prevent further Google atrocities,  the following measures should
be applied
 1) decentralise web services
 2) disclose source codes of web services
 3) make an easy and quick way to be registered anonymously
 4) never track users
 5) make the current Internet anonymous
 5.1) provide secure, fast, encrypted, available to everyone VPNs
 5.2) make an easy and quick way to change MAC address or spoof it
 5.3) use DNS over HTTPS (a.k.a. DOH) technology en masse
 6) use devices with pure Android firmware (no Google Play services, Facebook,
    and other bloatware)
 7) do not use any Apple devices

Noone cares about your privacy.
