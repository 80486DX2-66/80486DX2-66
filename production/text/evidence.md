2022 list (from newest to oldest):
* Life is about balance and harmony.
* *999999&nbsp;&#8725;&nbsp;777&nbsp;=&nbsp;142857.0*.
* An abundance of saturation often leads to a decrease in creativity. It is mostly about music and finding a soulmate.
* To achieve clean code and high performance, write programs in a pure machine-dependent assembly language. Do not strive for easy portability to other platforms. This way you won't have to constantly increase your computer's resources.
* It is believed that Electron.js can lead to so-called digital hell and general data clutter.
* Sometimes computer programs use darn big libraries for the sake of one daft function.
* A typical cool program in the current computer world is little available / left, have been released before ~2014; it is a cracked version or just freeware. 
  * e.g. *Exeinfo PE*, *Windows 7 in a Box*, *Adobe Photoshop*.
* CRT screens have a disadvantage: they flicker, and this greatly strains the human eye. A faint dot, gradually drawing out an image, runs across the screen very quickly. It creates a scanning effect, which can be seen in improper photos and videos. And there is also some ultraviolet radiation coming from the CRT, which plays a role in worsening eye health; it's like wearing the wrong sunglasses, the effect will manifest when you spend prolonged time in front of such a screen.
* Neil Armstrong was either specifically chosen to explore the moon, or he changed his name because if you take the first letter of his surname and put it together with the reversed first name, you get “AlieN”.
* The smaller the number of people with whom you talk, the greater the honesty and intensity of your feelings expressed in words.
* The users that spit the truth often either are anonymous or close their accounts; sometimes even getting banned.
* Computer technology and gadgets offer great opportunities and entertainment. From watching movies, listening to music and playing games to building artificial images using neural networks. Games, in turn, not only entertain people, but also teach them to look for the best tactics and train their brains.
* Oftentimes, the older a thing is, the more powerful words it is named.
  * For example, the [Hercules Graphics Card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercules_Graphics_Card) is called so after Hercules (Heracles).
* “Soul loves simple sound” — sine wave... and chiptunes and 1-bit DPCM music.
* “You” means referring to the organism — atoms, cells, organs, brain and soul.
* *116400&nbsp;&#8725;&nbsp;87&nbsp;=&nbsp;1337.9310344827586206896551724138*.
* *Quasi-*, *pseudo-*, *-esque*, *-like* share the common meaning.
* 60<sub>7</sub> = 42<sub>10</sub>.
* Eastern Arabic music = *Threshold of psychoacoustic intolerance* (not till the threshold, not over the threshold). Cacophony crosses the *threshold of psychoacoustic intolerance*.
* The thicker the harmonic (frequency) spectrum of an instrument, the higher its “atomic number”. The more consonants in a composition, the lighter it is. The more dissonances in a composition, the heavier it is.

2021 list:
* The worst case scenario is when the higher judges are ungodly bribesmiths who think you are a liar, and in fact you are an innocent teller of the truth.
* The divider in equation *10000&nbsp;&#8725;&nbsp;81&nbsp;=&nbsp;123.4567901234568* literally means to omit digit 8 in 1 cycle of period.
* When a question or problem is complex or there are several answers or solutions, speculation on the subject is called philosophy.
* Most animals below the human level (lower than human) have only intense emotions.
  1. You may experience such intense fear if you see a picture that triggers [trypophobia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypophobia).
* SARS-CoV-2 doesn't mutate. It's someone applies different types of the bioweapon of limited lifespans; thus we have waves of Covid.
* An excerpt from an array of mystical numbers: 7, 12, 16, 23, 42, 69, 137, 144, 333.
* Humans tend to think of time as a timeline, even though there is only entropy.
* Do we <ins>sob</ins> because we are being completely <ins>sober</ins>?
* A theory: humans perceive reality after some delay. In the meantime, brain can modify perceived reality with subconscious and conscious knowledge. There's a hypothesis: the function can be related to [a defence mechanism of the human psyche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_mechanism)
* Usually gold, techniques and aesthetics are coming back after a time interval.
  1. YouTube returned interactive channel logo in right bottom corner on videos.
  2. The global society began to value culture of 20th century again, especially 1990s aesthetics. This has had a great impact on music, films, videos, subcultures, online platforms, social networks, websites, etc.
* [The Creator (God)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God) does exist for real, and it can give you signs even if you don't believe in classical religions (even if you are a complete atheist).
  1. If you're a complete atheist, you can ruin your mental health because when you pray, your brain works in a special way.
* Newborns see the world in geometry and mathematics.
* The most peaceful Internet is located in comments under a recommended video on YouTube. For instance, a song from [Donkey Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_Kong), “Stickerbrush Symphony”. People are talking there about their problems, despite YouTube is not designed to 100% support comment replies. “Nintendo just destroyed the most beautiful place on the internet” – a random user said. That's because Nintendo deleted the video made by `taia777`, with their music.
* Zodiac signs and belief in strict predictions are amusements for not-so-smart.
* No kind person deserves to be constrained with bad feelings in their souls. This also applies to boredom.
* Less often, precisely pain prevents people from being creatively active.
* It's possible to download free and pirated content (computer software, music, films, etc.) and never have to pay any money online.
* Occasionally, one needs to perform robotic moves; generally behave like a programmed robot — monotone speech, careless manipulations, not care about anyone or anything, feel no emotions at all. It helps to cope with redundant, exorbitant feelings.
* If after a masturbation session one won't neither eat a [candy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candy), [dessert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dessert) (e.g. some [brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_sugar) sugar), cake, torte, [hakuto jelly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakuto_jelly), other confectionery product, drink a [cool beverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_drink), listen to uplifting music or communicate with significant other/happy people, then one will be depressingly sad (within 1+ hours) most probably.
* We are seeing unlimited [FPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate), compared to FPS on movies, [CRT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode-ray_tube)/[LCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display)/[LED](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LED_display) displays, and other electronic visual stuff. Life is not as smoothly as it could be because it's simply not vertically synchronized with the frequency of our eyes, with which they update their information.
* [Generation Z](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z) raised each other on the Internet. The ability is a new grade of human evolution — self-development at early stages.
* Life has too complicated rules and things (both good and bad; what to do and what to avoid) to explain to an alien.
* It is possible to create your own pet/companion/guard/helper of its individual existence (essence), with your own characteristics concepts.
* [Malware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware) [coders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer) often include (or have included, in [the previous century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_century)) moral motivations such as “Computer viruses are also programs/works of art”. Don't they want to tell us that Love is a [bug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bug_(engineering)) in the Matrix? As you could knew, both things are explainable on a physical, biochemical, and primarily psychological level. Bugs are mostly the inattention of the mind; and psychology is about mind and consciousness. Our brain works biochemically, on [electrical impulses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity#Electric_charge); and it often — in order not to be overworked too much — doesn't [debug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging) the software at the same time as [writing it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming). Love also works biochemically. It's a conscious relationship, and one's psyche is better when they loved by people around and close to him. Physically, biological processes work due to non-static molecules.
* Any [executable program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable) can be hacked and decrypted. It is machine instructions are executed, not encrypted data. Another thing is to analyze how the program works. Albeit, with the advent of neural networks, this can be done without the use of human forces.
* [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft) has long wanted to buy out [Mojang AB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojang_Studios), since [Notch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markus_Persson) copied the idea of the engine (running Steves in early alpha versions) from their [Microsoft Flight Simulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator). In September 2014, he finally sold it. The motive was the appearance of such a phenomenon as [*OldRoot*](https://gist.github.com/Voltasalt/ac431e32f1667e914897#oldroot).
* People put melodious and fascinating [ringtones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringtone) specifically to avoid answering [calls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_call).
* [Egyptians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptians) were the enemies of future [Europeans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_Europe), thus society is degrading.
* After death, one if he wants, can choose [heaven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven) or [hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell) or [another body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebirth_(Buddhism)). It all depends on what he wants.
* There can be two [souls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul) in a person — like two cores — [consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness) and [subconscious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subconscious) — they think of each other as subconscious. People with [schizophrenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia) can talk each other.
