For operating systems with TUI (like MS-, PC-, DR-, FreeDOS, Linux), in a
terminal/command prompt session, or in a special app:
  Escape
  Alt + X
  F10
  Ctrl + C
  Ctrl + D
  Ctrl + Z

If none of the above works, press Ctrl + Alt + Delete. If that doesn't help
either, turn the computer off and on again. If the computer fails to boot, then
BIOS/(U)EFI, ROM, or a combination of them is damaged; however, it could also
be a hardware problem.
