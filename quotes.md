[SecurityLab post](https://www.securitylab.ru/opinion/212066.php), translated by Google:
>As mentioned above, it is theoretically possible that when you rename a data file (for example, a graphic file with the JPG extension) in a file with the COM extension and run it as a program, destructive functions will be performed (information is destroyed). Should such a file be considered a bad program, and should a computer artist be held criminally liable under Article 273 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation? In addition, there are various platforms, programs for which may be incompatible in part or completely. As a result of incompatibility written for one platform, a very useful program can perform negative (destructive) actions when executed on another platform. Should such programs be called “negative”? Conversely, it is possible that another program for one platform will be completely harmless program for another platform.

> Ironically enough all the graphic formulas and voxel encoding engines created by [future crew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Crew) were stolen by [trident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trident_Microsystems), [s3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S3_Graphics), and [voodoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3dfx_Interactive), and were added as standard graphic decoders in all subsequent video cards chipsets ever made. &nbsp;They literally invented the programming technology in games we enjoy today, and are virtually unknown.

> The longer you have to wait for something, the more you will appreciate it when it finally arrives. The harder you have to fight for something, the more priceless it will become once you achieve it. And the more pain you have to endure on your journey, the sweeter the arrival at your destination. All good things are worth waiting for and worth fighting for.
